HONG KONG—Protesters smashed wall-size windows and stormed the city’s legislature on Monday, an unprecedented show of force that ratcheted up the worst social turmoil to rock Hong Kong since it returned to Chinese rule 22 years ago.

The mayhem at the government headquarters, which ended in barrages of police tear gas, capped a day in which 550,000 demonstrators marched peacefully through the streets in scorching summer heat, according to organizer estimates.

It was the third mass demonstration in under a month triggered by fears of Beijing’s growing influence over the city. A movement that had until now largely stuck to nonviolent means lurched toward anarchy among some of its members.

As mostly young activists broke the windows and defaced the legislative chamber, they described their rampage as a last-ditch effort to force the government to accede in a standoff over the city’s future.

The unrest spiraled after Hong Kong’s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, sought to pass legislation—since put on hold—that would allow suspects to be extradited to China, which has a far more opaque legal system.

The demonstrators demand that Mrs. Lam scrap the extradition proposal completely, launch an inquiry into police use of tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse an earlier protest, and resign her office.

A few opposition lawmakers tried unsuccessfully Monday to dissuade the more-aggressive activists from their assault on the legislative building.

Analysts warned that the protesters’ approach risked direct intervention from Beijing, which has largely tried to distance itself from the monthlong political turbulence.

“I think it puts Hong Kong in a very dangerous position because the Chinese government will ultimately interfere if it needs to,” said Steven Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.

Asked about the protest, President Trump said in Washington: “I hope it gets solved. I was with President Xi of China. We had a great talk, a great discussion, we’re talking about doing something and we talked about it briefly, but that’s very sad. I’ve rarely seen a protest like that.”

After using makeshift battering rams to break into the building, protesters used their umbrellas—long a symbol of peaceful resistance here—to smash exit signs and doors. Some hauled in metal barricades as if preparing for a siege, while others rifled through government papers strewn about with abandon.

“I want freedom,” said Joe, a recent university graduate who gave only his first name. “I don’t know if this will help or hurt the cause,” he said of the occupation. “I just followed the others.”
